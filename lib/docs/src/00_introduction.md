# Introduction

The [sophia crate](https://crates.io/crates/sophia) aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for working with RDF and Linked Data in Rust.

RDF is a data model designed to exchange knowledge on the Web in an interoperable way. Each piece of knowledge in RDF (a statement) is represented by a triple, made of three terms. A set of triples forms an RDF graph. Finally, several graphs can be grouped in a collection called a dataset, where each graph is identified by a unique name.
